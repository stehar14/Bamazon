# Bamazon Node and MySQL CLI Application

## Overview

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront built using MySQL and Node and utilizing the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. Additionally, managers can use the app to track inventory across the store and bolster inventory or add new products.
